<h1>Welcome to Software architecture laboratory</h1>
<h1>About us</h1>

<p>Software architecture is now understood by many as the center around which the whole software development should be carried out for efficient development of high quality software. For that, however, there should be many accompanying methods and techniques that enable utilization of software architecture.</p> 
<p>The central areas of interest of Software Architecture Lab, therefore, include practical and rigorous architecture description languages, analysis and reasoning techniques at the software architecture level and automation and verification methods for architecture-driven software development.</p>
